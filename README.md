# QR-Ticket-Generator

## Description
A simple CMS-style website, with a focus on MVC systems in the architectural structure. Using templates from Handlebars.js, Sequelize as the ORM, and Expess-session npm for authentication. Tailwind CSS has been used for all styling. The QR-Ticket-Generator dynamically generates concert tickets for users. It tracks user login information, tickets owned, and the corresponding venues for the show. Future enhancements include but are not limited to, bill and payment tracking, directions to the concert venue, and concert ratings and comments post show.

  ### User_Account

  This is where the data will go for the user account information. What do they see? What is available for them to do? Like, Ticket purchasing for upcoming shows, view tickets that they already have and the dates of those shows along with the venue. We can make seperate sections for each of those functions/pages and images as well. Then we can create links to them in the table of contents for the application.
